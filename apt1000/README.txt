This is a set of 2,134 'major' airports with the data extracted 
from X-Plane Airport & Navigation Data - 
 http://data.x-plane.com/get_data.html -
here presented in JSON format, as ICAO.json.

The files VERSION.apt.txt and VERSION.nav.txt give the respective versions 
of this data, and the file AptNavGNULicence.txt its license.

The criteria of selecting this set of major airports was that they have at 
least one ILS factility.

The json object present airport information, like its ICAO, location in WSG-84 
coordinates, being the simple average of the center of its runways, and name.

Then there are arrays for the runways, plus helipads and waterways, if any, 
ils objects, radios, and navaid within 100 nm of the airport.

Navaids beyond 100 nm have been added until a minimum of 10 objects are 
shown.

Additionally some of the information was output to a CSV files

apt1000-ils.csv  - The 2,134 airports with an ILS facility.
apt1000-icao.csv - All 27,000+ airports.
apt1000-nav.csv  - All 23,000+ navigations aids.
apt1000-heli.csv - All pure heliports.
apt1000-sea.csv  - All pure sea airports.

This json and csv was generated by a perl script - xp2csv.pl. The scripts used 
for this task are in the folder 'scripts', with a README.txt giving some more 
information.

The json validity was tested using the perl json parser, see chkjson.pl, and 
all passed.
