You will see that the 'Diagram' portion of FGx Plane Spotter 2.2 is highly blocky and colorful (and incomplete ;-)
 
Some of this appearance is just so you can see it from 'miles' away. But the other aspect is that we must invent new and clever ways of displaying this data in 3D. 

Certainly it is possible to imitate all the existing 2D things. And that could (and probably will) occupy some people's minds.

But we also have the opportunity of investigate whole new ways of visualizing this data in 3D.

And, in doing so, setting the precedents for whole new generations of future navigation visualizations.

Simply is there a way to represent STAR approaches
as data? And then there are SID (departures) which
can be equally 'complex'... And what are the
possible good sources for this data?
