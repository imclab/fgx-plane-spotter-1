FGx Plane Spotter Issues & Updates
==================================

2014-02-10 ~ FGx Plane Spotter r2 ~ Theo

FGx Plane Spotter is an app built upon a viewer [unFlatland]( http://jaanga.github.io/terrain-viewer/un-flatland/index.html ) which reads data from 
[Jaanga Terrain]( [unFlatLand]( http://jaanga.github.io/terrain/ ) and other cartography websites.
 
All the current features and issues of [unFlatLand]( http://jaanga.github.io/terrain-viewer/un-flatland/index.html ) are therefore features and issues with Plane Spotter r2.

A big issue with the current revision of unFlantland are the edge conditions described in 
[Jaanga Terrain Further Considerations]( http://jaanga.github.io/terrain/readme-reader.html#further-considerations.md).
All these issues appear to be solvable.

Issues pertaining to Plane Spotter r2 Beta include the following:

* What is the angle the ILS cone should make with the ground?
* How to calculate the radius of the base of the ILS cone?
* How to calculate accurately the correct scale for nautical miles - so as to provide a correct length for the ILS beam?
* Ditto the scale of meters so as to provide a correct width of the runways?
* Continuing to improve the accuracy of positioning elents - particularly their elevation

Coming in the upcoming betas:

* Display of FGx Crossfeed aircraft
* Permalinks for the airports
* First person camera
* Div showing all the current craft in service
* Camera on airport control tower
* Zoom level- dependent display of all 34K+ ICOA Objects
